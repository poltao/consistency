# paxoskv

It's a `rust` version of the repo [paxoskv](https://github.com/openacid/paxoskv/tree/naive) written in `golang`.

Thanks a lot to the original author [drmingdrmer](https://github.com/drmingdrmer) for the great work.

He's blog [可靠分布式系统-paxos 的直观解释](https://blog.openacid.com/algo/paxos/) and [200 行代码实现基于 paxos 的 kv 存储](https://blog.openacid.com/algo/paxoskv/) are very helpful to me.
